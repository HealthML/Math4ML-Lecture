# HPI Mathematics for Machine Learning Lecture

Here we upload the slide handouts for the HPI Mathematics for Machine Learning Lecture held at the HPI in the winter semester of 2020.

The Lecture videos can be found on this [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkxomGYFWp67infnvPmEcqyQqk0q6ntrY).

The lecture largely follows the [math4ML](https://github.com/gwthomas/math4mlI) notes (Garrett, 2018) and the book [Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://mml-book.github.io/) (Deisenroth et al., 2020).

This course has been funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in the project KI-LAB-ITSE (project number 01\|S19066).
